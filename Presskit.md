### Description

Card Caster is a high fantasy action-adventure game that takes insperation from Nintendo's Legend of Zelda. Card Caster follows our protaganist Casper as he sets out on a journey to find his purpose in life. Casper comes from a long lineage of card casters, a type of mage who can cast spells sealed within cards. This gives card caster the ability to use almost any spell so long as they have the appropriate card and enough mana to cast the spell. However after a card is cast some time must pass before the caster may use that card again, so card casters often carry a deck of cards so that they are never left defenceless. Casper is a fairly young and inexperienced caster so he can only hold up to three cards in his hand while the rest must remain in his untile he uses one of the cards in his hand.

Join Casper on his journey to explore the world, fight monsters, find treasure, and solve puzzles

### History

Originally Card Caster was going to be a turn based RPG, but the team wanted to have puzzles for the character to solve using his various cards, however we found it difficult find a way to mess puzzles with a turn based combat, so we discarded the idea of having turn based combat. Instead we decided to model our game on the 2D Legend of Zelda games.
